Our team is basing our project idea on the "Quick, Draw!" Kaggle competition which classifies 
user drawings into one of 340 label categories. Drawings may be incomplete or not match the label.
The challenge is to effectively build a recognizer that can work with this noisy data. The challenge
is unique from an algorithmic perspective because the data includes both time series and pattern
recognition components; areas that have traditionally used two different types of Neural Network
Architectures.
